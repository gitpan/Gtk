0.1.16		Fri Apr 10, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.10:
	
		Memory management overhauled, should be much better. Gtk_objects
		shouldn't leak in any common cases. (They'll be cleaned up soon
		after all Perl and Gtk references vanish. Note that as soon as Perl
		sees any gtk_object, it'll forge a connection that lasts until the
		object is completely unreferenced. It is therefore safe to refer to
		the Perl side from Gtk/C code, or store data in the Perl side.
		
		This requires some GC magic, which is reliable & safe, but is
		slightly time-consuming. Be aware that idle & timer tasks are being
		used by perl to implement this garbage collection.)
		
		Support added for most Gnome widgets, including GtkTty widget set
		(including GtkLed), and the Gnome UI widget set. Please read
		Makefile.PL for the list of available flags. (You may need to patch
		up libraries or headers to build properly.)
		
		The Gnome support currently places the gnome-* widgets into the
		Gtk::Gnome::* namespace, and only includes widget support -- no
		other Gnome functions are bound.

		More of Paolo Molaro's <lupus@lettere.unipd.it> patches applied.
		

0.1.16		Fri Apr  3, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.8:

		Primarily fixes substantial bug with boot_ invocation.

0.1.14		Sun Feb 22, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.3:
	
		Adaptions to gtk-0.99.3, nothing major.

0.1.13		Tue Jan 13, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.2:
	
		Reorganized code to break each modules into separate .xs files. 
		Should not break when a widget isn't present, if the .h file is
		removed along with the library.

0.1.12		Sun Dec 14, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-971109:
	
		Adds missing Atoms.pm file.
		
		Adds widget creation (the ability to create new Gtk widgets from
		Perl). This is still mostly busted, look in widget.pl for a possibly
		comprehensible example. (Signals are completely busted.)

0.1.11		Wed Nov 19, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-971025:
	
		Adds gtk_selection handling (Owen Taylor, thanks!) to Gtk.pm and
		test.pl.
		
		Adds Gtk::Atom module to allow tied-hash access to atoms via
		%Gtk::Atom.
