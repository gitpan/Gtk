01-15-99 Kenneth J. Albanowski <kjahds@kjahds.com>
	* This marks the 0.5000 point release of the Perl/Gtk module.
	* Fixed gdkimlib example to point to a real image.
	* Makefile.PL punctuation.

01-13-99 Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi> 
	* Makefile.PL fix - get gnome libs correctly

01-13-99 Kenneth Albanowski <kjahds@kjahds.com>
	* Merged my changes for lazy loading, and Perl 5.003/5.005 support.
	* Miscellaneous repairs for error trapping, etc.
	* GtkGLArea usable (with separate OpenGL module).
	* Fixed Tuomas' ChangeLog entries to be in the right year. :-)
	
01-12-99 Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi> 
	* Small change to let Makefile.PL check for gdkimlib and
	gnome automatically and take them automatically if they exist.
	For the sake of tired sysadmins who have gnome and from whom
	someone requests gnome-perl ;)

Tue Jan 12 14:06:51 EST 1999 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* removed a bunch of auto-generated files from cvs, and added 
	.cvsignores appropriately (sorry about Gnome/pkg.pl - don't know
	how that got committed like that)

01-12-99 Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi> 
	* Got back some of earlier changes for new gnome compatibility

01-11-99 Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi>

	* fixed Gnome/pkg.pl syntax

Mon Jan 11 15:34:55 EST 1999 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	Applied patch from Franklin Belew <frb@umr.edu>
	* Makefile.PL, Gnome/pkg.pl: now uses gnome-config and sets NEW_GNOME
	environment variable if appropriate (should cause systems that 
	previously would not build the Gnome module to build again)

12-29-98 Kenneth Albanowski <kjahds@kjahds.com>

	Major rearrangement, to stick Gtk & Gnome back together into a single
	build environment. Many more Gtk+ versions should be properly supported
	now, roughly from 0.99.10 to 1.1.9. Gnome, XmHTML, GdkImlib, and Zvt
	have been tested. Gnome-panel and Gtk-tty have not. Some Gnome
	functionality has been reverted to match the 0.30 release -- define
	NEW_GNOME to get the new stuff back.
	
	ColorSelectButton (and other Perl widgets) is broken at the moment, due
	to an init problem I've not solved yet. Look at NOTES for more
	information on this and other things.
	
	0.5000 point release expected soon.

12-26-98 Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>

	* Made gnome work -- removed deprecated ColorSelector

12-26-98 Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>

	* Gnome should now work from other directories than default.

12-23-98 Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>

	* Integrated more of 0.4, specifically genext stuff

Tue Dec 22 13:16:26 EST 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* took out references to argp (they weren't necessary anyways)
	- also I see in the ChangeLog that Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	is the one who made it use the gnome and imlib stuff by default.
	I'm going to write some tester functions to check to see if you
	have this stuff before it compiles it.  I want it buildable on
	a gtk-only system, too, without any mods.

Mon Dec 21 20:23:20 EST 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* we compile again.  there are still some problems where it's
	force-requiring gnome when I didn't tell it to specifically use
	gnome (it should also compile with JUST Gtk+) but I'll work on
	that later.  I needed gnome-perl to work again :)

1998-12-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* GnomeCanvas.xs: Removed gnome_canvas_set_size().

12-4-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>

	* Various patches from Marin Purgar <pmc@iskon.hr>

Wed Dec  2 21:54:03 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* sync with GTK+ 1.1.6.

Tue Nov 24 20:50:33 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* config/pkg-gtk-1.1.defs: GTK+ 1.1.5 redefs

Mon Nov 23 05:47:53 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* sync for GTK+ 1.1.5. I #if 0'd some stuff out, added
	add_with_viewport to GtkScrolledWindow, set_snap_to_ticks for
	GtkSpinButton, and made test.pl use em.

11-21-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* CTree small functions continued
	* Table small functions
	* GtkContainer::check_resize

11-21-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* Small patch from Marin Purgar <pmc@iskon.hr>

11-21-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* CList column function additions

11-20-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* Import more stuff (CTree)  from newer versions
	* get new defs file including CTree &c.

11-18-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* Add GtkLayout.c to .cvsignore
	* Add Gnome::Pixmap::file

11-17-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* Add method vbox to GnomeDialog.xs
	* Fix stock button error message


11-17-98  Tuomas J. Lukka  <lukka@iki.fi>
	* Add test scripts from Gnome-0.3000
	* Add support for stock buttons and menuitems
	* Add gnome-test/dialog.pl to test the stock buttons and dialogs.


11-17-98  Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi>
	* Gtk::Gnome:: -> Gnome:: everywhere (as perl Kenneth Albanowski's version 0.4)
	  NOTE: THIS BREAKS ALL APPLICATIONS THAT USE ANY SYMBOLS IN THE Gtk::Gnome NAMESPACE.

		  perl -p -i.bak 's/Gtk::Gnome/Gnome/g' *

	  will work wonders, unless you have binary files.

	  I'm going to continue getting the CVS version up to 0.3000 and 0.4 level in 
	  Kenneth Albanowski's distributions.

	* Make --with-gnome and --with-gdkimlib the default when compiling

11-17-98  Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi>
	* retrofit a GnomeAbout.xs fix from Gnome-0.3000
	* retrofit BEGIN{} in Gnome.pm

11-17-98  Tuomas J. Lukka <lukka@iki.fi>
	* take gnome-config, not gtk-config

Tue Nov 10 11:10:53 EST 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* new --all option
	* everything should compile again. (we hope)
	* applied patch from Göran Thyni <goran@kirra.net>

Mon Oct 12 21:48:50 CDT 1998 Frank Belew <frb@umr.edu>

	* removed all references to gtktty
	* fixed pkg-gnome.pl to use gnome-config
	* fixed pkg-gtkxmhtml.pl
	* removed gnomeConf.sh stuff from Makefile.PL and fixed typo

Mon Oct 12 19:48:17 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.PL: recognize GTK_CONFIG in %ENV

Sat Sep 19 20:28:50 EDT 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	attempting to update gnome-perl in cvs to something a little more
	recent.  Incidentally - it was not raster that did the gnome-perl
	work :)  Amazing how raster gets credit for everything *grin*

0.3			Sun Aug 16, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk+-1.0.5 or gtk+-1.1.1 (with glib-1.1.2).
	
	Duplication of Rasterman's gnome-perl work for Gtk-1.1.1 support.  This
	was not done by directly merging his code, so I may have left some
	things out, and I've not tested the result with every possible package.
	
	Integrated some of PMC's patches.
	
	Configuration mechanism cleaned up quite a bit, so that separate
	packages are quite modular, to the point that gtk-1.0 and gtk-1.1 are
	treated as separate packages on top of the base "gtk" package.
	
	Version number sequence changed, yet again. Sigh.
	
0.2_04		Sat Aug  1, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk+-1.0.5.
	
	Added Marin Purgar's <pmc@iskon.hr> patches and test.pl improvements.
	
	Added test.pl support for scrolling (buggy, though), mainloop, etc.
	
	Added Brian Warner's patch for notebook test.
	
0.2_03		Sun Jun  7, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk+-1.0.4.
	
	Started to add support for sensible struct types, as opposed to boxed
	types. (Basic idea is pass-by-value as opposed to pass-by-refernce.)
	
	Version numbering changed to trip up less code. (Hopefully.)
	
	Added some colormap & color support.
	
	Added testpdl.pl program to demonstrate very crude use of PDL with
	previews.  (Thanks to Marc Lehmann for the idea.)
	
	Modified GtkColorSelectButton widget to prepend all internal variables
	with underscore.

0.2.2		Wed May 27, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk+-1.0.3 (may also work with 1.0.1 & 1.0.2)

	Added Gtk::Object->new_from_pointer and $GtkObject->_return_pointer
	methods that allow raw GtkObject* values (expressed as integers),
	including GtkWidget* and other descendant types, to be converted
	into the equivalent Perl types, and vice versa.
	
	$Gtk::VERSION now provided.
	
	Partial color_context support added to Gtk, and sample6 (test of Gtktty)
	now allocates colors properly.
	
	Added preliminary GtkPacker support. (Disabled, edit end of gendefs.pl
	to renenable. testpacker.pl's options are buggy, in a suspicious
	manner.)
	
	Added basic support for a few of the newer Gnome widgets.

0.2.1		Thu May  7, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Included a variation of a module contributed by Dov Grobgeld
	<dov@Orbotech.Co.IL>, GtkColorSelectButton.pm, which demonstrates a
	functional Gtk widget created in Perl.
	
	Some fixes to widget creation were needed to get that running.
	
	Fixed some memory leaks, affecting, among other things, input handlers.
	
	Added AUTOLOAD facility to Gtk::Object, allowing Gtk variables to be
	reffered to via gettor/settor methods. Thus:
	
		$object = new Gtk::Widget "Button", -width => 30;
		print $object->get('width'); # 30
		print $object->width; # 30, same as above
		$object->set('width' => 40);
		$object->width(40); # same as above

	One incompatible change: constants for enums and flags now use
	underscores instead of hyphens. (This looks a bit more ugly, but is more
	flexible, as an underscore is a legal character in a Perl symbol.)

0.2.0		Thu May  7, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-1.0.1


0.1.16		Fri Apr 10, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.10:
	
		Memory management overhauled, should be much better. Gtk_objects
		shouldn't leak in any common cases. (They'll be cleaned up soon
		after all Perl and Gtk references vanish. Note that as soon as Perl
		sees any gtk_object, it'll forge a connection that lasts until the
		object is completely unreferenced. It is therefore safe to refer to
		the Perl side from Gtk/C code, or store data in the Perl side.
		
		This requires some GC magic, which is reliable & safe, but is
		slightly time-consuming. Be aware that idle & timer tasks are being
		used by perl to implement this garbage collection.)
		
		Support added for most Gnome widgets, including GtkTty widget set
		(including GtkLed), and the Gnome UI widget set. Please read
		Makefile.PL for the list of available flags. (You may need to patch
		up libraries or headers to build properly.)
		
		The Gnome support currently places the gnome-* widgets into the
		Gnome::* namespace, and only includes widget support -- no
		other Gnome functions are bound.

		More of Paolo Molaro's <lupus@lettere.unipd.it> patches applied.
		

0.1.16		Fri Apr  3, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.8:

		Primarily fixes substantial bug with boot_ invocation.

0.1.14		Sun Feb 22, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.3:
	
		Adaptions to gtk-0.99.3, nothing major.

0.1.13		Tue Jan 13, 1998	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-0.99.2:
	
		Reorganized code to break each modules into separate .xs files. 
		Should not break when a widget isn't present, if the .h file is
		removed along with the library.

0.1.12		Sun Dec 14, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-971109:
	
		Adds missing Atoms.pm file.
		
		Adds widget creation (the ability to create new Gtk widgets from
		Perl). This is still mostly busted, look in widget.pl for a possibly
		comprehensible example. (Signals are completely busted.)

0.1.11		Wed Nov 19, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski

	Uses gtk-971025:
	
		Adds gtk_selection handling (Owen Taylor, thanks!) to Gtk.pm and
		test.pl.
		
		Adds Gtk::Atom module to allow tied-hash access to atoms via
		%Gtk::Atom.
