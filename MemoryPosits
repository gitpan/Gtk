	Desired results of memory management (these don't match current
	results.)

Given:

  {
     my $label = new Gtk::Label "foo";
  }


Result:

  no leakage, $label released from Perl and Gtk upon exit of loop.



Given:

  {
     my $label = ForeignCObject; # This function returns a pre-allocated Gtk object
  }

Result:

  leakage. $label released from Perl, but Gtk object unreleased.
