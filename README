Usage information: this package was designed around gtk 970606, and there is
no guarantee it will work with any other distributions, or indeed even that
one. To build, install Gtk in your system, then run 'perl Makefile.PL', and
'make test', and then 'make install' if all went well.

The code may very well still have leaks, and a few portions are incomplete
(such as Gdk colormap manipulation) and much of it is untested. No
documentation currently exists, but this code is designed to mimic the C
calling sequences as much as is reasonable.

Please bring information regarding bugs and other issues to
<gtk-list@redhat.com> or the author, at <kjahds@kjahds.com>.

Good Luck,
Ken
